NeroJTAG is yet another protocol for a USB JTAG adaptor. On the host side there is a simple library
"libnero", and a patch for Zolt√°n Csizmadia's excellent xilprg (programmer for Xilinx FPGAs), and a
simple XSVF player. You can get the host stuff by downloading the Neopurgo package from here:

    https://github.com/makestuff/neopurgo

On the device side, there are two implementations of the NeroJTAG protocol, one for the Cypress FX2
chip (included in the Neopurgo package above) and one for the Atmel USB AVRs, included here. The
firmware currently targets the AT90USB162. Change the Makefile if you have a different MCU.
Suitable hardware platforms include the Nanduino, Teensy, Benito etc etc.

The project build assumes this directory ("neroJtag") lives within a structure like this:
