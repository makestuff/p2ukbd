A PS2->USB adapter with support for macros. Based heavily on the
LowLevel/Keyboard demo from LUFA.

The built-in macros allow you to push key events down to the host OS, even if
you're in a VirtualBox guest. So right-menu + left-arrow or right-arrow allows
you to switch between multiple full-screen desktops, each of which might have a
VirtualBox guest running. You can also press right-menu + Fn to get F13-F24
keystrokes, which you can map in your host OS. See here for a quick demo:

I haven't implemented the keyboard LEDs. Maybe I'll do it one day, but to be
honest I don't really miss the LEDs!

BUILDING

On Windows you'll need:
  * WinAVR (http://winavr.sourceforge.net)
  * Atmel FLIP (http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3886)

On Linux you'll need:
  * sudo apt-get install gcc-avr
  * sudo apt-get install avr-libc
  * sudo apt-get install dfu-programmer

Install MakeStuff build infrastructure (see http://bit.ly/makestuff):
  curl -sL http://www.swaton.ukfsn.org/bin/makestuff-lindar-20110912.tar.gz | tar zxf -

Fetch p2ukbd and build:
  cd makestuff/apps
  ../common/msget.sh p2ukbd
  cd p2ukbd/
  make

Flashing the firmware:
  On Linux: sudo make dfu
  On Windows: make flip
